\section{\scshape Example}
\subsection{[[is_prime]]}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{[[Example]]}

\begin{itemize}
\item We want to write a website which yields the next prime number when
a user inputs a prime.

\item Let's write a function which checks if a number is prime.
\end{itemize}

<<Check if prime>>=
def is_prime(n):
@

\begin{itemize}
\item We can now write a few cases which we can discard
\end{itemize}

<<Early discard for checking if prime>>=
  if n is 2:
    return True

  if n < 2 or n % 2 is 0:
    return False
@
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{[[is_prime]]}
\begin{itemize}
\item Now let's write a basic loop to check if this number [[n]] is a prime number.
\item We can do this by considering numbers in a certain range. If any of the
      numbers being considered are factors of [[n]], [[n]] is not prime.
\item Let's set the interval between numbers to $2$ since we don't need to consider
      even numbers. This means [[start]] needs to be odd.
\end{itemize}

<<Loop to check if prime>>=
  for i in range(start, end, 2):
    if n % i is 0:
      return False
    return True
@

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{[[is_prime]]}
\begin{itemize}
\item We can be smart about the checking for factors by defining a good range.
\item Obviously, the starting number cannot be smaller than $2$, since we already
      check if a number is divisible by 2. Let's set [[start]] to $3$.
\end{itemize}

<<Prepare loop to check if prime>>=
  start = 3
@

\begin{itemize}
\item We can set the end of the range to be [[n]] itself, but we should only check
      for one of the factors not both.
\item We do this by taking $\sqrt{n}$, then rounding down.
\item This requires the [[math]] package.
\end{itemize}

<<Prepare loop to check if prime>>=
  end = int(math.floor(math.sqrt(n)))
@

<<Packages to import>>=
import math
@
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{[[is_prime]]}

\item Let's finish assembling our [[is_prime]] function.

\subsection{[[next_prime]]}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{[[next_prime]]}

      which no calculating is required.

  if n < 2:
    return 2

\subsection{[[next_prime]]}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{[[next_prime]]}
\begin{itemize}
\item We can assess all numbers above the given number
      until a prime is found. Let's skip even numbers.
\end{itemize}

<<Loop to find next prime>>=
  while True:
    n += 2
    if is_prime(n):
      return n
@

\subsection{[[next_prime]]}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{[[next_prime]]}
\begin{itemize}
\item What happens if [[n]] is even?
\item Need to adjust [[n]] before assuming [[+= 2]] skips
      even numbers.
\end{itemize}

<<Adjust even number before loop to find prime>>=
  if n % 2 is 0:
      n -= 1
